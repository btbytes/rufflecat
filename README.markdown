# Ruffle Cat 

Ruffle Cat is a raffle app for iphone.

See it in action here : [http://rufflecat.appspot.com](http://rufflecat.appspot.com).

I wrote it after the August 2009 [Indypy](http://indypy.org), the Indianapolis Python User Group, meeting as an "upgrade"
to an existing console  raffle script that was running on a fellow pythonista's iphone. We use it to give out door prizes 
at the end of every meetup. 

I used [iui](http://code.google.com/p/iui/) User Interface framework.
